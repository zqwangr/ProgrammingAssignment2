## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
##benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. 
##The following is a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  invm <- NULL
  set <- function(y) { 
    x <<- y 
    invm <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x    
  setinvm <- function(invertm) invm <<-invertm
  getinvm <- function() invm
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinvm = setinvm,
       getinvm = getinvm)
  
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
##then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  invm <- x$getinvm()
  if(!is.null(invm)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(invm)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  invm <- solve(data)
  x$setinvm(invm)
  invm
  
}
